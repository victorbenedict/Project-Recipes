    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups fresh raspberries</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh blackberries</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 package powdered pectin</li>
        <li>4-5 clean, sterile 8-ounce canning jars with lids and rings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, mix together the raspberries, blackberries, lemon juice, and sugar. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Cook the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar has dissolved and the berries have begun to break down and release their juices.</li>
        <li>Add the powdered pectin to the pot and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to a rolling boil and let it boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and skim off any foam that has formed on top.</li>
        <li>Ladle the hot jam into the clean, sterile canning jars, leaving about 1/4 inch of headspace at the top.</li>
        <li>Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean, damp cloth to remove any drips or spills.</li>
        <li>Place the lids on the jars and screw on the rings until they are just tight.</li>
        <li>Process the jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes, making sure the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars.</li>
        <li>Remove the jars from the water bath and let them cool on a wire rack. Once they are cool, check to make sure the lids have sealed properly by pressing down on the center of each lid. If the lid pops up and down, the jar did not seal and should be refrigerated and consumed within a few weeks. Sealed jars can be stored in a cool, dark place for up to a year.</li>

    </ol>
